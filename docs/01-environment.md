# Development Environment

To ensure that all participants have a consistent environment and avoid the need for reconfiguring your personal setup, we recommend using an Ubuntu VM (locally on your machine) pre-configured with all the development tools that you will need during the Bootcamp. These tools include:
Python 3.8
Poetry 1.2
PyCharm
gh cli
jq
